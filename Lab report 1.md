cd: The change directory command requires a directory input to do anything, hence why nothing happened.

ls: the ls command lists files and directories on what is essentially the root, the only files that show up upon this command are going to be the ones at the root like Lecture1 and lab1, due to them being the master folders.

cat: the cat command reads data in a file, and due to the lack of a file selected, nothing happens.
