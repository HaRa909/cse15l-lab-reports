cd: The change directory command requires a directory input to do anything, hence why nothing happened when there was no directory specified. This is a soft error as there was no error message, but nothing happens in response to the command.

ls: the ls command lists files and directories on what is essentially the root, the only files that show up upon this command are going to be the ones at the root like Lecture1 and lab1, due to them being the master folders. There is no error as the comand worked exactly as it was meant to.

cat: the cat command reads data in a file, and due to the lack of a file selected, nothing happens.

ls: the lecture1 directory contains Hello.class, Hello.java, messages, and README in it, making it so that when the ls command is carried out, all files and directories inside the lecture1 folder are displayed.

cat: Due to the fact the cat command is carried out in a directory, it displays the "Is a directory" message because of the lack of files to read.
