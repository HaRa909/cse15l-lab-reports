cd: The change directory command requires a directory input to do anything, hence why nothing happened.

ls: the ls command lists files and directories on what is essentially the root, the only files that show up upon this command are going to be the ones at the root like Lecture1 and lab1, due to them being the master folders.

cat: the cat command reads data in a file, and due to the lack of a file selected, nothing happens.

cd: The change directory command is given a directory to go to, the lecture1 directory, and so changes the location to the lecture1 directory.

ls: the lecture1 directory contains Hello.class, Hello.java, messages, and README in it, making it so that when the ls command is carried out, all files and directories inside the lecture1 folder are displayed.

cat: Due to the fact the cat command is carried out in a directory, it displays the "Is a directory" message because of the lack of files to read.

cd: Using the cd command on an actual file doesn't work, hence why the error "Not a directory" is displayed, cd is meant to navigate directories and not files.

ou’ll submit a lab report by writing a blog post about the basic filesystem commands we learned today. You should create the post, like we just described using Github Pages. The lab report is due Monday, October 9 by 10pm. See the FAQ below for common questions, including how to add images and what to submit to Gradescope.

For each of the commands cd, ls, and cat, and using the workspace you created in this lab:

Share an e
Share an 
Share an
So that’s 9 total examples (3 for each command). For each, include:

A screenshot or Markdown code block showing the command and its output
What the working directory was when the command was run
A sentence or two explaining why you got that output (e.g. what was in the filesystem, what it meant to have no arguments).
Indicate whether the output is an error or not, and if it’s an error, explain why it’s an error.
You will upload your submission by publishing the page on Github Pages, then printing the page to PDF and uploading to the Lab Report 1 assignment on Gradescope.
